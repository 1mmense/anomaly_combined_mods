	<string id="st_wpn_desert_eagle_dhampyr_descr">
		<text>A more modernized version of the Desert Eagle, with a build-in compensator and picatinny rails, on frame and slide. Knowing that so, it still has quite a recoil but much lower than any other Desert Eagle, let alone magnum, the slight barrel improvements also improve the accuracy by a bit, and it's possible to insert some scopes. It seems to be of relatively new shape, but looking at the slide and the magazine, it claims to use .50AE and yet it's feeding on .357 Magnum. Without a doubt, it was modified right in The Zone, perhaps by Nimble himself.\n \n

		<text>Nimble's Blueprint that came with the gun itself as a bonus. This allows it to change the caliber to 1.27x55mm, but you'll have only one in the magazine.</text>
